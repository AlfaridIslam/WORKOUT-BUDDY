Technical Details:

Frontend: The user interface is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.
Backend: The server-side logic is implemented using Express.js and Node.js, ensuring efficient data handling and smooth operation.
Database: MongoDB is used as the database for storing user and workout data, providing robust and scalable data management.
Future Enhancements:

The future scope of the project includes features like social sharing, where users can share their workout details with friends, and gamification elements to make the process of tracking workouts more engaging and fun.

This project showcases the power of the MERN stack in building dynamic, data-driven web applications, and serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to maintain a regular workout routine.
